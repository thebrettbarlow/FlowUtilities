# SplitString
I've been splitting String Variables in my Flows for a long time and it's always way harder than it needs to be. Did you know there's a .split() method in Apex? That's way easier!

Just pass this the String Variable you need to split, tell it which character separates your values and it'll pass you back a String Collection Variable containing those values.  

For more information on how to use this, check out the the comments within the Apex Class and the video below:
