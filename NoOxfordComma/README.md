# NoOxfordComma
What would you do if you had a String Collection of values and needed to display them on a screen in a human-readable format? Well, this Flow Utility will turn those values into a comma separated sentence without the Oxford Comma.

Just pass it the String Collection and Finishing Word you want to use and it'll return a String Variable for you to use. Example with "and" as my Finishing Word: Value 1, Value 2 and Value 3
