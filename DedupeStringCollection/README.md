# DedupeStringCollection
Have you ever needed to deduplicate a String Collection in a Flow? You could use Loops, Decisions and Assignments to do this in Flow but it's not efficient and will fail if your Collection is too large. Instead, just pass this Flow Utility the String Collection you need to dedupe and it'll return a deduped version.  

For more information on how to use this, check out [this video](https://google.com){:target="_blank"} and the comments within the Apex Class.
